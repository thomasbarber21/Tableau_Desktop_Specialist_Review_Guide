# Tableau Desktop Specialist Review Guide

This Dashboard was created to help review and prepare for the Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification Exam. It covers most topics that were seen on the exam and helped me to pass 
the certification on the first try.

To view the final dashboard simply select the png file. I have also included the Tableau Workbook file as well. The interactive nature of the dashboard can be explored through that 
file, or it is also available on my Tableau Public profile linked below.
